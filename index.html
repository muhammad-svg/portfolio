      <h3>Dogs of Ghana Blog</h3>
      <p><a href="https://dogsofghana.blog" target="_blank">Visit: dogsofghana.blog</a></p>

      <p>This blog highlights the beautiful and unique dogs found across Ghana. I built and designed it myself and optimized it for mobile, speed, and SEO. The blog recently received its first two clicks â€” a proud step as I build visibility. This is a showcase of my beginner-level blogging and SEO skills.</p>

      <h3>Clothing Queen GH - Social Media Campaign</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/clothing_queen_gh/#" target="_blank">Visit: clothing_queen_gh</a></p>

      <p>I managed the Instagram presence of a male wholesale clothing store focused on attracting retailers and, secondarily, consumers. I created high-quality promotional designs using Canva, wrote sales-oriented captions, and published engaging posts. The campaign included a Meta (Facebook & Instagram) ad to drive DMs, which resulted in many inquiries and one successful sale in 24 hours.</p>
